[h1]Current Version: 1.0.0 "Temujin" (Released 9/13/20, Compatible with vanilla patch 1.0.X)[/h1]
[B]Please See [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/mod-viet-events-for-ck3-a-flavor-and-immersion-event-mod.1422081/]Forum Thread[/url] For More Info[/B]
[B]Manual Download/Installation available [url=https://github.com/cybrxkhan/VIET-Events-for-CK3/releases]on Github[/url]
[/B]

Very Immersive Events and Tales (VIET), the sequel to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1601402546]VIET Events Reborn for CK2[/url], is a flavor mod that adds a vast collection of events about everyday life to spice up your game. These events add immersion and a diversity of experiences in between wars and vanilla’s event chains, and cover mundane minutiae ranging from small talk with courtiers and eating local cuisine to epic tales about love, philosophy, and the human condition.

Alongside many new events, I intend to adapt many of the events from the old VIET for CK2 as possible. I hope the lessons I learned from my eight years (with a hiatus) of modding CK2 will help me deliver a fun experience for any players interested in my mods.

As this is the early version of VIET, I welcome any and all feedback - I'm still getting the hang of switching to CK3 modding from CK2's. Please let me know if you encounter any bugs, or if you feel the events fire too frequently or not frequently enough. While the events may get repetitive if you play long enough as I haven’t added that many yet (which is similar to what happens with vanilla CK3 anyways), [B]I hope to continue adding more and more events in every update![/B]

[B][U]VIET [I]will[/I] work on existing saves![/U][/B] Depending on your RNG luck, it might just take a while for events to pop up as there are only 108 events and counting at the moment (sounds like a lot but it isn't compared to the CK2 version). In my test games I've had stretches of a decade or two with no events, and suddenly a bunch happen within the span of a few years. Anyways, if using on a save game, always make a backup just in case.

Feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up. And if you liked the mod, feel free to favorite and rate it up!

[LIST]
[*]Over [B]108 new flavor events[/B] and event chains, and more will be added in updates over time
[*]Game rule to disable sillier events for those who don't like them, with three levels to choose from: Balanced (Default), Serious (Restricted), and All Events (Full)
[*][B]Compatible with almost anything[/B] since it doesn't touch any vanilla files - even with overhaul mods, you can via game rule disable events that reference things specific to our medieval world that wouldn’t make sense in other time periods or universes (like fantasy and sci-fi conversion mods)
[*]Learn history with [B]Historical Context tooltips[/B] that provide information about what inspired some of the events - sometimes, reality is stranger than fiction! (These can be disabled via game rule for those who find it immersion breaking.)
[*]NOT achievement compatible!

[h1]TRANSLATIONS AVAILABLE[/h1]
Please be aware that due to my irregular schedule for updating my mods, the folks working on these translations may or may not be up to date with the latest version of VIET as they are kindly spending their own free time and effort to work on these. However, any part of the mod that isn't translated yet will still have English localization, so you won't see random code gibberish and it will be safe to run in other languages.

A huge thanks to the teams of WTWSMS (especially ILikeTrians and Loup99) and Lux Invicta (including tsf4), as well as M@ni@c, creator of Hide Your Jewelry, for maintaining and improving on VIET for CK2 over the years, which provided me a solid foundation for improved reboot of VIET Events.

Credits also to OrdepNM, who was my partner in crime in the early days of VIET for CK2 and who stepped up to help maintain it while I had serious medical issues years ago.

Special thanks to Sleight of Hand for pushing me to get into the CK2 modding scene and for other assistance over the years, which is why I am still here for some reason.

Lastly, thanks to all the people who I worked with, took stuff from over the years, and provided encouragement and feedback.
