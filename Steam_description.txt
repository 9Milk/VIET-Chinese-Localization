Very Immersive Events and Tales (VIET), the sequel to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1601402546]VIET Events Reborn for CK2[/url], is a flavor mod that adds a vast collection of events about everyday life to spice up your game. They add immersion and a diversity of experiences in between wars and vanilla’s event chains, and cover mundane minutiae from small talk with courtiers and eating local cuisine to epic tales about love, philosophy, and the human condition. I hope the lessons I learned from my eight years (with a hiatus) of modding CK2 will help me deliver a fun experience for any players interested in my mods.

Let me know if you encounter any bugs. [B]I hope to continue adding more and more events in every update![/B] Please note that [B][U]VIET IS NOT ACHIEVEMENT COMPATIBLE![/U][/B]

[B][U]VIET [I]WILL[/I] WORK ON EXISTING SAVES![/U][/B] (Though remember to make a backup copy of your save just in case.)

Feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up. And if you liked the mod, feel free to favorite and rate it up!

[LIST]
[*]Over [B]567 new flavor events[/B] to experience!
[*]Explore new decisions, character interactions, and event chains
[*]Game rule to disable sillier events for those who don't like them, with three levels to choose from: Balanced (Default), Serious (Restricted), and All Events (Full)
[*][B]Compatible with almost anything[/B] since it doesn't touch any vanilla files - even with overhaul mods, you can via game rule disable events that reference things specific to our medieval world that wouldn’t make sense in other time periods or universes (like fantasy and sci-fi conversion mods)
[*]Learn history with [B]Historical Context tooltips[/B] that provide information about what inspired some of the events - sometimes, reality is stranger than fiction! (These can be disabled via game rule for those who find it immersion breaking.)
[/LIST]

[h1]TRANSLATIONS AVAILABLE[/h1]
We now have every official language covered! Due to my irregular schedule for updating my mods, and the fact that people are kindly spending their own free time and effort to work on them, [B]please be aware that the folks working on these translations may or may not be up to date with the latest version of VIET[/B]. Do note that all non-English languages available in the vanilla game has placeholder English localization in the base version of VIET so they can be safely run, it will just display everything in English.

[h1]Version 1.4.3 "Zhuazhou"[/h1]

[I]Zhuazhou is the Chinese term for a ritual held on a child’s first birthday, where the baby gets to choose between different objects symbolizing careers or personality traits; the chosen object is used to forecast the child’s future. This ritual is a common practice throughout the Sinosphere, and is known as Thôi Nôi for Vietnamese, Doljabi for Koreans, and Erabitori for Japanese.

This update is intended to coincide with the one year anniversary of CK3 VIET’s release. Thanks to all the players and modders involved in my wonderful start to CK3 modding - with your support, I'm sure VIET (and RICE) will continue to grow with more fun events and features over time![/I]

[LIST]
[*]Added mini event chain about the Dreamer (4 events)
[*]Added new crows decision event chain with 20 events and 2 decisions:
[LIST]

[*]Added new nicknames: Lord of the Crows & Lady of the Crows
[*]Added a few new event background variations
[*]Enabled “Dreamer” option for a couple previously added events where other people recount meeting the Dreamer
[*]Made several changes to the event about female Chinese polo players: new option for women, some options are disabled depending on gender doctrine, and historical context has been added
[*]Traveler from the left for dead event now has a chance of dying if you choose to leave them
[*]Changed ambient noise of a few event backgrounds to make more logical sense
[*]Fixed the length of the permanent eye damage modifier to now be forever for the staring at the sun event
[*]Fixed Qi Ma getting pruned (albeit with a wonky workaround)
[*]Miscellaneous bugfixes
[/LIST]

*Adapted from VIET for CK2

A huge thanks to the teams of WTWSMS (especially IlikeTrains and Loup99) and Lux Invicta (including tsf4), as well as M@ni@c, creator of Hide Your Jewelry, for maintaining and improving on VIET for CK2 over the years, which provided me a solid foundation for improved reboot of VIET Events.

Credits also to OrdepNM, who was my partner in crime in the early days of VIET for CK2 and who stepped up to help maintain it while I had serious medical issues years ago.

Special thanks to Sleight of Hand for pushing me to get into the CK2 modding scene and for other assistance over the years, which is why I am still here for some reason.

Thanks to tora75 for contributing the Norse unique localizations for several events.

Huge thanks also to the various kind souls who are taking the time to translate the mod - you can see the full list of them in the "Features" section in the Steam mod page description.

Lastly, thanks to all the people who I worked with, took stuff from over the years, and provided encouragement and feedback.
