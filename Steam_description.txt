[h1]Current Version: 1.0.1 "Hieronymus Bosch" (Released 9/16/20, Compatible with vanilla patch 1.0.X)[/h1]
[B]Please See [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/mod-viet-events-for-ck3-a-flavor-and-immersion-event-mod.1422081/]Forum Thread[/url] For More Info[/B]
[B]Manual Download/Installation available [url=https://github.com/cybrxkhan/VIET-Events-for-CK3/releases]on Github[/url]
[/B]

Very Immersive Events and Tales (VIET), the sequel to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1601402546]VIET Events Reborn for CK2[/url], is a flavor mod that adds a vast collection of events about everyday life to spice up your game. These events add immersion and a diversity of experiences in between wars and vanilla’s event chains, and cover mundane minutiae ranging from small talk with courtiers and eating local cuisine to epic tales about love, philosophy, and the human condition.

Alongside many new events, I intend to adapt many of the events from the old VIET for CK2 as possible. I hope the lessons I learned from my eight years (with a hiatus) of modding CK2 will help me deliver a fun experience for any players interested in my mods.

As this is the early version of VIET, I welcome any and all feedback - I'm still getting the hang of switching to CK3 modding from CK2's. Please let me know if you encounter any bugs, or if you feel the events fire too frequently or not frequently enough. While the events may get repetitive if you play long enough as I haven’t added that many yet (which is similar to what happens with vanilla CK3 anyways), [B]I hope to continue adding more and more events in every update![/B]

[B][U]VIET [I]WILL[/I] WORK ON EXISTING SAVES![/U][/B] (Though remember to make a backup copy of your save just in case.)

Feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up. And if you liked the mod, feel free to favorite and rate it up!

[LIST]
[*]Over [B]141 new flavor events[/B] and event chains, and more will be added in updates over time
[*]Game rule to disable sillier events for those who don't like them, with three levels to choose from: Balanced (Default), Serious (Restricted), and All Events (Full)
[*][B]Compatible with almost anything[/B] since it doesn't touch any vanilla files - even with overhaul mods, you can via game rule disable events that reference things specific to our medieval world that wouldn’t make sense in other time periods or universes (like fantasy and sci-fi conversion mods)
[*]Learn history with [B]Historical Context tooltips[/B] that provide information about what inspired some of the events - sometimes, reality is stranger than fiction! (These can be disabled via game rule for those who find it immersion breaking.)
[*]NOT achievement compatible!

[h1]Version 1.0.1 "Hieronymus Bosch"[/h1]

[I]Hieronymus Bosch was a renowned Dutch painter from the 15th century, most famous for his vivid and fantastical depictions of life and hell. His paintings were unusually macabre and surreal for the time, featuring terrifying imagery that reflected a deeply religious man who wished to express moralistic, spiritual themes in his work.[/I]

A huge thanks to the teams of WTWSMS (especially IlikeTrains and Loup99) and Lux Invicta (including tsf4), as well as M@ni@c, creator of Hide Your Jewelry, for maintaining and improving on VIET for CK2 over the years, which provided me a solid foundation for improved reboot of VIET Events.

Credits also to OrdepNM, who was my partner in crime in the early days of VIET for CK2 and who stepped up to help maintain it while I had serious medical issues years ago.

Special thanks to Sleight of Hand for pushing me to get into the CK2 modding scene and for other assistance over the years, which is why I am still here for some reason.

Huge thanks also to the various kind souls who are taking the time to translate the mod - you can see the full list of them in the "Features" section in the Steam mod page description.

Lastly, thanks to all the people who I worked with, took stuff from over the years, and provided encouragement and feedback.
