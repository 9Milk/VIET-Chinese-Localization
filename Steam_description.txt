Very Immersive Events and Tales (VIET), the sequel to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1601402546]VIET Events Reborn for CK2[/url], is a flavor mod that adds a vast collection of events about everyday life to spice up your game. They add immersion and a diversity of experiences in between wars and vanilla’s event chains, and cover mundane minutiae from small talk with courtiers and eating local cuisine to epic tales about love, philosophy, and the human condition. Some of the events unlock new decisions, character interactions, activities, and much more for you to explore!

I hope the lessons I learned from my eight years (with a hiatus) of modding CK2 will help me deliver a fun experience for any players interested in my mods.

Let me know if you encounter any bugs. [B]I hope to continue adding more and more events in every update![/B] Please note that [B][U]VIET IS NOT ACHIEVEMENT COMPATIBLE![/U][/B]

[B][U]VIET [I]WILL[/I] WORK ON EXISTING SAVES![/U][/B] (Though remember to make a backup copy of your save just in case.)

Feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up. And if you liked the mod, feel free to favorite and rate it up!

[LIST]
[*]Over [B]774 new flavor events[/B] to experience!
[*]Explore new decisions, artifacts, character interactions, activities, and more!
[*]Game rule to disable sillier events for those who don't like them, with three levels to choose from: Balanced (Default), Serious (Restricted), and All Events (Full)
[*][B]Compatible with almost anything[/B] since it doesn't touch any vanilla files - even with overhaul mods, you can via game rule disable events that reference things specific to our medieval world that wouldn’t make sense in other time periods or universes (like fantasy and sci-fi conversion mods)
[*]Learn history with [B]Historical Context tooltips[/B] that provide information about what inspired some of the events - sometimes, reality is stranger than fiction! (These can be disabled via game rule for those who find it immersion breaking.)

[h1]TRANSLATIONS AVAILABLE[/h1]
Because people are kindly spending their own free time and effort to work on these transations, [B]please be aware that the folks working on these translations may or may not be up to date with the latest version of VIET[/B]. Do note that all non-English languages available in the vanilla game has placeholder English localization in the base version of VIET, so they can be safely run, it will just display untranslated text in English (instead of gibberish).

[h1]Version 1.5.0 "Zhao Mingcheng"[/h1]

[I]Zhao Mingcheng was a Chinese poet, politician, scholar, and antiquarian of the Song Dynasty. He was the husband and lover of Li Qingzhao, one of the greatest female poets in Chinese literary history. The couple spent years amassing and cataloging a large collection of ancient art and artifacts. Contrary to other scholars of his day, Zhao stressed the importance of ancient inscriptions and objects as primary historical sources. Sadly, the two lost much of their collection during the Jurchen invasion of Song China, and Zhao passed away shortly afterwards, leaving his widow to continue his legacy.[/I]

A huge thanks to the teams of WTWSMS (especially IlikeTrains and Loup99) and Lux Invicta (including tsf4), as well as M@ni@c, creator of Hide Your Jewelry, for maintaining and improving on VIET for CK2 over the years, which provided me a solid foundation for improved reboot of VIET Events.

Credits also to OrdepNM, who was my partner in crime in the early days of VIET for CK2 and who stepped up to help maintain it while I had serious medical issues years ago.

Special thanks to Sleight of Hand for pushing me to get into the CK2 modding scene and for other assistance over the years, which is why I am still here for some reason.

Thanks to tora75 for contributing the Norse unique localizations for several events.

Special thanks to Stik, Vertimnus, and Tobbzn on the CK3 Mod Co-op for helping me figure out how to adapt my CK2 province events and do a system for county events for CK3.

Huge thanks also to the various kind souls who are taking the time to translate the mod - you can see the full list of them in the "Features" section in the Steam mod page description.

Lastly, thanks to all the people who I worked with, took stuff from over the years, and provided encouragement and feedback.
