Very Immersive Events and Tales (VIET), the sequel to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1601402546]VIET Events Reborn for CK2[/url], is a flavor mod that adds a vast collection of events about everyday life to spice up your game. These events add immersion and a diversity of experiences in between wars and vanilla’s event chains, and cover mundane minutiae ranging from small talk with courtiers and eating local cuisine to epic tales about love, philosophy, and the human condition.

Alongside many new events, I intend to adapt many of the events from the old VIET for CK2 as possible. I hope the lessons I learned from my eight years (with a hiatus) of modding CK2 will help me deliver a fun experience for any players interested in my mods.

Feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up. And if you liked the mod, feel free to favorite and rate it up!

[LIST]
[*]Over [B]108 new flavor events[/B] and event chains, and more will be added in updates over time
[*]Game rule to disable sillier events for those who don't like them, with three levels to choose from: Balanced (Default), Serious (Restricted), and All Events (Full)
[*][B]Compatible with almost anything[/B] since it doesn't touch any vanilla files - even with overhaul mods, you can via game rule disable events that reference things specific to our medieval world that wouldn’t make sense in other time periods or universes (like fantasy and sci-fi conversion mods)
[*]Learn history with [B]Historical Context tooltips[/B] that provide information about what inspired some of the events - sometimes, reality is stranger than fiction! (These can be disabled via game rule for those who find it immersion breaking.)
[*]NOT achievement compatible!

A huge thanks to the teams of WTWSMS (especially ILikeTrians and Loup99) and Lux Invicta (including tsf4), as well as M@ni@c, creator of Hide Your Jewelry, for maintaining and improving on VIET for CK2 over the years, which provided me a solid foundation for improved reboot of VIET Events.

Credits also to OrdepNM, who was my partner in crime in the early days of VIET for CK2 and who stepped up to help maintain it while I had serious medical issues years ago.

Special thanks to Sleight of Hand for pushing me to get into the CK2 modding scene and for other assistance over the years, which is why I am still here for some reason.

Lastly, thanks to all the people who I worked with, took stuff from over the years, and provided encouragement and feedback.
