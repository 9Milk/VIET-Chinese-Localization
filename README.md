# VIET Events for CK3

## BETA Version

[Under Construction]


## Features

- Over 108 new flavor events and event chains, and more will be added in updates over time - these include events from VIET Events for CK2, as well as entirely new ones
- Game rule to disable sillier events for those who don't like them, with three levels to choose from: Balanced (Default), Serious (Restricted), and All Events (Full)
- Compatible with almost anything since it doesn't touch any vanilla files - even with overhaul mods, you can via game rule disable events that reference things specific to our medieval world that wouldnâ€™t make sense in other time periods or universes (like fantasy and sci-fi conversion mods)
- Learn history with Historical Context tooltips that provide information about what inspired some of the events - sometimes, reality is stranger than fiction! (These can be disabled via game rule for those who find it immersion breaking.)
- NOT ACHIEVEMENT COMPATIBLE!
